**Spring** 

The Spring Framework provides *a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform*. A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.

The Spring Framework (Spring) is an open-source application framework that provides infrastructure support for developing Java applications. One of the most popular Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) frameworks, *Spring helps developers create high performing applications using plain old Java objects (POJOs).*

<br>

**SpringMVC**

The Spring Web MVC framework provides *Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and ready components that can be used to develop flexible and loosely coupled web applications*. The MVC pattern results in separating the different aspects of the application (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), while providing a loose coupling between these elements.

The Model encapsulates the application data and in general they will consist of POJO. The View is responsible for rendering the model data and in general it generates HTML output that the client's browser can interpret. The Controller is responsible for processing user requests and building an appropriate model and passes it to the view for rendering.

springMvc是spring基础之上的一个MVC框架，主要处理web开发的路径映射和视图渲染，属于spring框架中WEB层开发的一部分；

**SringBoot**

*Spring Boot is a lightweight framework that takes most of the work out of configuring Spring-based applications.* Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

If you’re looking for information about a specific version, or instructions about how to upgrade from an earlier release, check out the project release notes section on our wiki.


1. springMvc属于一个企业WEB开发的MVC框架，涵盖面包括前端视图开发、文件配置、后台接口逻辑开发等，XML、config等配置相对比较繁琐复杂；

2. springBoot框架相对于springMvc框架来说，更专注于开发微服务后台接口，不开发前端视图，同时遵循默认优于配置，简化了插件配置流程，不需要配置xml，相对springmvc，大大简化了配置流程；

**SpringCloud**

*Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems (e.g. configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, micro-proxy, control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership election, distributed sessions, cluster state)*. Coordination of distributed systems leads to boiler plate patterns, and using Spring Cloud developers can quickly stand up services and applications that implement those patterns. They will work well in any distributed environment, including the developer’s own laptop, bare metal data centres, and managed platforms such as Cloud Foundry.

**MyBatis**

*MyBatis is a first class persistence framework with support for custom SQL, stored procedures and advanced mappings.* MyBatis eliminates almost all of the JDBC code and manual setting of parameters and retrieval of results. MyBatis can use simple XML or Annotations for configuration and map primitives, Map interfaces and Java POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) to database records.
<br>
<br>

**Hibernate**

*Hibernate is a high-performance Object/Relational persistence and query service,* which is licensed under the open source GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and is free to download. Hibernate not only takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database tables (and from Java data types to SQL data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities. This tutorial will teach you how to use Hibernate to develop your database based web applications in simple and easy steps.

MyBatis是一个持久层（DAO）框架，本质上是JDBC的一次封装。
DAO (DataAccessobjects 数据存取对象)是指位于业务逻辑和持久化数据之间实现对持久化数据的访问。通俗来讲，就是将数据库操作都封装起来。

Both Hibernate and iBATIS are open source Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tools available in the industry. Use of each of these tools depends on the context you are using them.

**struts**

Apache Struts is a free, open-source, MVC framework for creating elegant, modern Java web applications. It favors convention over configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with plugins to support REST, AJAX and JSON.
